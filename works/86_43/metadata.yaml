  –   & –      & The 1805 version of this work (\A1, HerEy 86)
                 comprises the first section (“Si consistant”, 45 bars),
                 a middle section (“Unam petii”, 69 bars) for harmonium
                 (denoted “Baritono”) and male choir (TTBB),
                 and the final section (“Si consistant”, 43 bars).
                 By contrast, the 1827 versions (\A2 and prints) replace the
                 harmonium in the middle section by 2 ob, 2 fag, and 2 cor.
                 Version 1827a, represented by \A2 (HerEy 43), is similar
                 to \A1: It lacks bars 71–75 and is therefore five bars
                 shorter (i.e., 64 bars in total).
                 Moreover, in bar 70, there are slight changes to the choir.
                 By contrast, version 1827b, represented by \C1 and \C2,
                 contains an even shorter middle section (31 bars in total),
                 which lacks bars 77–109. Thus, when performing this version,
                 one has to jump from the end of bar 76 to the beginning of
                 the final section (as indicated by the segnos),
                 and the male choir has to sing the 1st \quarterNote. \\
